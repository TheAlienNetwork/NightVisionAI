My Suggestions: What Software You Should Use / Try

Since you're exploring detective work as a civilian or private investigator, here are tools & approaches you could adopt that balance power, cost, and legality:

Digital Forensics Toolkit

Tools like Autopsy (open source), The Sleuth Kit, NetAnalysis (if accessible) to examine browser/data traces.

Use for preserving digital evidence: browser history, social media posts, metadata of images/videos.

Video / Image Analysis Tools

Use software like OpenCV + FFmpeg for extracting frames, detecting flashes or anomalies.

For confirming visual matches, use perceptual hashing (imagehash, etc.).

Software like InVID (for video verification) can help check provenance of videos, see if they're edited or manipulated.

Case / Evidence Management Systems

Something like an evidence-management dashboard — think timelines, relational graphs, map overlays. Could be custom (using e.g. Neo4j + GIS tools) or commercial.

Data Aggregation / Public Records Search Tools

Subscription services or APIs to access court documents, news archives, public property / license plate records, social media public posts.

Services like Tracers (for public records & skip tracing) or other OSINT tools.

Predictive and Analytic Visualization Tools

Use mapping tools (GIS) + crime pattern analysis tools to see when/where events cluster.

Visual dashboards combining dispatch logs, video camera locations, timelines.

Legal / Reasoning Tools

Tools like LAPIS for reference of legal constraints and to help with what is allowed in an investigation (searches, privacy limits).

Document / affidavit templates with version tracking.
